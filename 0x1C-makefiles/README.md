# Learning Objectives :bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

### What are make, Makefiles? 
* If you want to run or update a task when certain files are updated, the make utility can come in handy. The make utility requires a file, Makefile (or makefile), which defines set of tasks to be executed.
  
### When, why and how to use Makefiles
* Compiling the source code files can be tiring, especially when you have to include several source files and type the compiling command every time you need to compile. Makefiles are the solution to simplify this task.
### What are rules and how to set and use them 
* The general syntax of a Makefile target rule is:
````
  target [target...] : [dependent ....]
[ command ...]
````
**NOTE** âˆ’ In this example, you would have to give rules to make all object files from the source files.

### What are explicit and implicit rules
