## [0. Multiple mains](./0-main.c)
* In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in [an earlier C project](https://github.com/lperezcas16/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c).

## [1. main](./1-main.c)
* Copy this main file. Comment out (dont delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

## [2. 0 > 972](./2-largest_number.c)
* This program prints the largest of three integers.

## [3. Print remaining days](./3-print_remaining_days.c)
* This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
