## Learning Objetives :bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What are nested loops and how to use them.
* What is a function and how do you use functions.
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function.
* What is a prototype

---
### [0. is upper](./0-isupper.c)
* Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

### [1. is digit](./1-isdigit.c)
* Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

### [2. mul](./2-mul.c)
* Write a function that multiplies two integers.

### [3. Print_numbers](./3-print_numbers.c)
* Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9.

### [4. Print_most_numbers](./4-print_most_numbers.c)
* Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9.

### [5. More_numbers](./5-more_numbers.c)
* Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14.

### [6. Print line](./6-print_line.c)
* Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

### [7. Print diagonal](./7-print_diagonal.c)
* Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

### [8. Print square](./8-print_square.c)
* Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

### [9. Fizz-Buzz](./9-fizz_buzz.c)
* The Fizz-Buzz test is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who cant seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

### [10. Triangles](./10-print_triangle.c)
* Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

### [11. Prime factor](./100-prime_factor.c)
* The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.

Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

### [12. Print number](./101-print_number.c)
* Write a function that prints an integer.
