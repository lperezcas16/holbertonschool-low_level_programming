## Learning Objetives :bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What are nested loops and how to use them.
* What is a function and how do you use functions.
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function.
* Scope of variables

## Content 

### [0. holberton](./0-holberton.c) 
* Write a program that prints Holberton, followed by a new line.

## [1. alphabet](./1-alphabet.c)
* Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase.

## [2. print_alphabet_x10](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c)
* Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase

## [3. is lower](./3-islower.c)
* Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

## [4. is alpha](./4-isalpha.c)
* Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

## [5. sign](./5-sign.c)
* Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

## [6. abs](./6-abs.c)
* Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

## [7. Print_last_digit](./7-print_last_digit.c)
* Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

## [8. 24 hours](./8-24_hours.c)
* Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

## [9. times table](./9-times_table.c)
* Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

## [10. add](./10-add.c)
* Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

## [11. print_to_98](./11-print_to_98.c)
* Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

## [12. times_table](./100-times_table.c)
* Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.

## [13. natural](./101-natural.c) 
* If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

## [14. fibonacci](./102-fibonacci.c)
* Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.

## [15. fibonacci](./103-fibonacci.c)
* Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.

## [16. fibonacci](./104-fibonacci.c)
* Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.
